# Fish support for Visual Studio Code

## Looking for maintainer

I'm not longer interested in maintaing this extension since
I'm not using VScode anymore. If someone is interested in
taking it over, please open an issue. In the meantime
I'm happy to merge PRs and upload new versions to marketplace.

Support for Fish shell scripts.

Simple conversion from [fish TextMate Bundle](https://github.com/l15n/fish-tmbundle).
All credits goes to Leonard CHIN.
